# Login-Page
In this repo, I have created a login page using HTML & Javascript with Firebase Authentication as backend database. 


User Signup and Login 👥👥

The platform begins with a signup page where students can create an account. Upon successful registration, they can log in using their credentials to access the platform's features.
